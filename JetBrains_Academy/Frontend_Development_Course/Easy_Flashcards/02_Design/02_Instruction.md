Description
    You got to the most creative part of the project: design! 
    It's time to work out what your web-page should look like.
    You can make the decisions as you go, draw a tentative plan on a paper, or even use a design app like Figma.
    Feel free to express your creativity, though there are some restrictions: since projects are about learning, restrictions are necessary for educational and testing purposes.

    Don't forget to add a CSS file to the src folder and include a link to it in HTML; otherwise, the added styles will not apply.

    First of all, let's design our flashcards. 
    Set the size of divs with questions (notice: the cards are square), add color to the background, round the corners if you want, and position the text inside.
    Then form a table from the cards. 
    We suggest using the following model of a page and CSS properties grid/flex.
    <img href="https://ucarecdn.com/0ebb6172-7cbd-4433-a840-bc2b9bb2650f/">

    Set the background for the element that contains all the cards and the title. 
    We used the picture of the world map, but you can make a solid background if you prefer.

    As a final touch, change the fonts of the title and the text on your flashcards.

    Be careful, don't use extra elements without need
    
Objectives
    1. Make a set of square flash cards.
    2. Set the background for the cards and the whole page using the CSS property background-image/background-color.
    3. Position the cards using the CSS property grid/flex so they make a 3x3 table.
    4. Set the fonts for the text.
