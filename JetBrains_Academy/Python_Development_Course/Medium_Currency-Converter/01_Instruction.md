Description
    Today we start our new project. It will be a simple currency converter. 
    Every person sometimes needs to convert one currency to another. 
    But we need to start easy, so for now, all you need to do is to print "Meet a conicoin!" 
    Please, make sure that the output formatting of your program follows the example output formatting.

Objectives
    Imagine that there is a cryptocurrency called conicoin ("coni" is just an anagram of the word "coin"). 
    Greet conicoin as shown in the example below.

Example
    Output:
        Meet a conicoin!
