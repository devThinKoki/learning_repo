<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Let's think about what a loan calculator should be able to do.</p>
<p>In general, it takes several parameters like a "loan principal" and "interest", calculates the values the user wants to know (for example, monthly payment or overpayment), and outputs them to the user.</p>
<p># 대출 계산기가 주로 하는/해야할 일을 파악하기</p>
<p>    # loan principal, interest(이자) 등의 인자를 취하기</p>
<p>    # 사용자가 원하는 값(매달 지출액, 추가 지출액 등)등 계산하여 출력하기</p>

<p>Not familiar with these concepts? Don't worry, we will explain them to you in simple terms.</p>
<p>The principal is the original amount of money you borrow.</p>
<p>The interest is a charge for borrowing that money, usually calculated as a percentage of the principal amount.</p>
<p># 간략히 용어 살피기</p>
<p>    # principal: 빌린 원금</p>
<p>    # interst: 돈을 빌린데에 대한 대가(이자), 대게 원금에 대한 퍼센트로 계산한다.</p>


<h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>Let's start by imitating this behavior.</p>
<p>There are some prepared variables in the source code: these are text messages that our loan calculator can output.</p>
<p>In this stage, all you need to do is output them in the right order.</p>
