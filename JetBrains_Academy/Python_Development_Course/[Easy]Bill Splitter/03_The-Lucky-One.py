# Description
    # In this stage, you need to add a new feature to the project â€” pick one name from the dictionary at random; this person's share will be paid by others. Make it a lucky day for somebody!

    # Make sure you give your users a choice whether they want to use this feature or not. Don't turn it on by default.

    # After picking a random name, print it so that everyone knows who is the lucky one.

# Objectives
    # In this stage your program should perform the following steps together with the steps from the previous stages:
        # In case of an invalid number of people, "No one is joining for the party" is expected as an output;
        # Otherwise, ask the user whether they want to use the "Who is lucky?" feature;
        # Take input from the user;
        # If a user wants to use the feature (Yes), choose a name from the dictionary keys at random and print the following: {Name} is the lucky one!;
        # If the user enters anything else, print No one is going to be lucky.
    # Do not print the output of the previous stage (see examples).

# Examples
    # The greater-than symbol followed by a space (> ) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.

    # Example 1: The feature is used
        # Enter the number of friends joining (including you):
        # > 5

        # Enter the name of every friend (including you), each on a new line:
        # > Marc
        # > Jem
        # > Monica
        # > Anna
        # > Jason

        # Enter the total bill value:
        # > 100

        # Do you want to use the "Who is lucky?" feature? Write Yes/No:
        # > Yes

        # Jem is the lucky one!

    # Example 2: The feature is skipped
        # Enter the number of friends joining (including you):
        # > 5

        # Enter the name of every friend (including you), each on a new line:
        # > Marc
        # > Jem
        # > Monica
        # > Anna
        # > Jason

        # Enter the total bill value:
        # > 100

        # Do you want to use the "Who is lucky?" feature? Write Yes/No:
        # > No

        # No one is going to be lucky

    # Example 3: Invalid input
        # Enter the number of friends joining (including you):
        # > 0

        # No one is joining for the party

# write your code here
import random
people = dict()
people_in_list = list()

how_many = int(input())

if how_many <= 0:
    print("No one is joining for the party")
else:
    print("Enter the name of every friend (including you), each on a new line:")
    for i in range(how_many):
        name = input()
        people[name] = 0
        people_in_list.append(name)
    print()

    print('Enter the total bill value: ')
    total_value = int(input())
    for key, value in people.items():
        people[key] = round(total_value/len(people), 2)
    print()

    print("Do you want to use the \"Who is lucky?\" feature? Write Yes/No: ")
    answer = input()
    print()

    if answer == 'Yes':
        randomIdx = random.randint(0, len(people_in_list)-1)
        
        Name = people_in_list[randomIdx]
        print(f"{Name} is the lucky one!")
    else:
        print("No one is going to be lucky")
