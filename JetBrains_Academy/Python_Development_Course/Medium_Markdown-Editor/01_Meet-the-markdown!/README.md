## ***Needed Skills***
- Introduction to Python
- Overview of the basic program
- ***Markdown***

# Goal
Learn the basic syntax of the markdown language and try to determine the source code of the snippet.

# ***Description***
Welcome to the first stage of the project!

If you have worked with the markdown, you will probably recognize the following syntax:
```
# The Beatles
One may say that they were the most famous **rock band** ever.
The legendary **line-up** comprised the following people:
* *John Lennon*
* *Paul McCartney*
* *George Harrison*
* *Ringo Starr*
```

Yes! It is a raw markdown code. It translates into:

The legendary **line-up** comprised the following people:
* *John Lennon
* *Paul McCartney
* *George Harrison
* *Ringo Starr
<hr>

# ***Objectives***
Determine and print the source (raw) markdown code of the markdown snippet below.<br>
Show your understanding of the syntax basics.<br>
You can use [the Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) as it covers all the necessary topics.

Below is the snippet to complete this stage. Once you write it in the markdown syntax, put it into triple quotes and print it:
