# Goal
Write a program that puts some basic information on the screen: let the machine describe what it takes to make a cup of coffee!

# Description
Let's start with a program that makes you a coffee - virtual coffee, of course.<br>
In this project, you will implement functionality that simulates a real coffee machine.<br>
It can run out of ingredients, such as milk or coffee beans, it can offer you various types of coffee, and, finally, it will take money for the prepared drink.

# Objectives 
The first version of the program just makes you a coffee.<br>
It should print to the standard output what it is doing as it makes the drink.

# Example
Take a look at the sample output below and print all the following lines.

### **Output**:
```
Starting to make a coffee
Grinding coffee beans
Boiling water
Mixing boiled water with crushed coffee beans
Pouring coffee into the cup
Pouring some milk into the cup
Coffee is ready!
