It was tough to organize codes well.
if there is any repeated code it is better to wrap it as function.
but sometime(maybe I on the way to studying it.)
function need to use global variables and make it change.
so i can't make it in module (can't we use global variables which actually are in in different file ?)

and each step I had to fix my code little bit.

even this challenge was easy level.
it was hard as medium level project(simple banking system) to me.
haha anyway!
thank you for make me do some hard work!

I will keep moving on!
