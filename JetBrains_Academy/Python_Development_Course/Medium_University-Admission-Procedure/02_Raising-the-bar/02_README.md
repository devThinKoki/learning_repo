# Goal
- Set the mean score threshold and determine whether the applicants are going to be enrolled.

# Description
- It'd be great if universities could enroll everybody, but it's not very realistic, is it?<br>
Let's refine our algorithm.<br>
In this stage we need to set a threshold of the mean score â€” if the mean score of the applicant is equal to or greater than 60.0, the program should notify the applicant about the acceptance to the university.<br>
Otherwise, inform them about the rejection.

# Objective
- At this stage, your program should:
    1. Read the numbers and output the mean score, as in the previous stage.
    1. If the mean score is equal to or greater than 60.0, output the following message: `Congratulations, you are accepted!`
    1. If the mean score is less than 60.0, output the following message: `We regret to inform you that we will not be able to offer you admission.`
    
# Example
- The greater-than symbol followed by a space (> ) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the output.

- Example 1: the applicant is enrolled
```
> 70
> 56
> 81
69.0
Congratulations, you are accepted!
```

- Example 2: the applicant is rejected
```
