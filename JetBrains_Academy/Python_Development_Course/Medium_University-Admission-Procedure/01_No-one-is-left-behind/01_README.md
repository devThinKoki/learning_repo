# Description
- Let's create a program that will help the university to determine the best candidates for enrolling!<br>

- The first step is very simple.<br>
An applicant needs to take three exams and submit the scores.<br>
The score of an exam can vary from 0 to 100.<br>
Your program should read the numbers representing the exam scores, calculate the mean exam score, and output it.<br>
And enroll the applicant to the university, as there are no other contestants yet.

# Objective
- At this stage, your program should:
    1. Take three inputs as integer numbers.<br>
    They are the exam results.
    1. Calculate the mean score of all three numbers.<br>
    If the mean is a fractional number, don't discard the fractional part.
    1. Print the resulting number.
    1. Print the `Congratulations, you are accepted!` line.

# Example
- The greater-than symbol followed by a space (> ) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the output.

- Example 1
```
> 75
> 90
> 68
77.66666666666667
Congratulations, you are accepted!
