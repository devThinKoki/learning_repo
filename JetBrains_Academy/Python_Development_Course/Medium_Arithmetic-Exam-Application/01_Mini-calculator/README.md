# Goal
- Write a mini calculator to work with numbers and simple mathematical operations.

# Description
- People learn new things in one way or another.<br>
Learning sometimes means that you need to check your comprehension by taking a test.<br>
It also requires a person (or a program) to check your answers.<br>
You may have been in a situation when you think that you have solved the task correctly, but your professor has a different (sometimes wrong!) answer.<br>
It happens; everybody makes mistakes.

- Not our application though.<br>
It should calculate the solution in a very precise manner.<br>
We need to make a simple calculator that can evaluate expressions like `a + b`, `a - b`, or `a * b`.<br>
We will leave the division aside for now.

# Objectives
1. A user inputs a line that looks like a simple mathematical operation.
2. The application should print the result of the operation

# Examples
- The greater-than symbol followed by a space (> ) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.

### Example 1:
```
> 5 + 7
12
```

### Example 2:
```
> 3 * 100
300
```

### Example 3:
```
> 5 - 10
-5
```

### Example 4:
```
> 8 * 0
0
```
