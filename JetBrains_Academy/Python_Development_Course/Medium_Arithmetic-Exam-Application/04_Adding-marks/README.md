## ***Needed Skills***
- **Type casting**
- String formatting
- ***`Time module`***
- **Writing files**

# Goal
- Solving mathematical expressions is helpful, but many students prefer to get marks.<br>
Let's add marks and save the results!

# Description
- Simple tasks are good for younger kids, but math can be more difficult and more interesting!<br>
Quadratic equations, trigonometry, and a lot of other interesting things.<br>
Math library can help you with that.

- Sometimes students want to save the results of the test.<br>
This is useful for viewing the learning dynamics on a topic or to identify difficult tasks.

- At this stage, let's add integral squares.<br>
Of course, you can add more difficulty levels later.

# Objectives  
1. With the first message, the program should ask for a difficulty level:<br>
    `1 - simple operations with numbers 2-9`<br>
    `2 - integral squares 11-29`

2. A user enters an answer.<br>
For the first difficulty level: the task is a simple math operation; the answer is the result of the operation.<br>
For the second difficulty level: the task is an integer; the answer is the square of this number.<br>
In case of another input: ask to re-enter and repeat until the format is correct.

3. The application gives 5 tasks to a user.

4. The user receives one task, prints the answer.<br>
If the answer contains a typo, `print Incorrect format.` and ask to re-enter the answer.<br>
Repeat until the answer is in the correct format.<br>
If the answer is a number, print `Right!` or `Wrong!` and move to the next question.

5. After five answers, print `Your mark is N/5.` where **N** is the number of correct answers.

6. Output `Would you like to save your result to the file? Enter yes or no.`<br>
In case of `yes`, `YES`, `y`, `Yes`: the app should ask the username and write `Name: n/5 in level X (<level description>).` (X stands for the level number) in the `results.txt` file.<br>
For example â€” `Alex: 3/5 in level 1 (simple operations with numbers 2-9).`<br>
The results should be saved to the file immediately after the user gave the positive answer to the question `Would you like to save your result to the file?`<br>
If the file `results.txt` does not exist, you should create it.

7. In case of `no` or any other word: exit the program.

# Example
- The greater-than symbol followed by a space (`> `) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.

### **Example 1**:
```
Which level do you want? Enter a number:
1 - simple operations with numbers 2-9
2 - integral squares of 11-29
> 11
Incorrect format.
Which level do you want? Enter a number:
1 - simple operations with numbers 2-9
2 - integral squares of 11-29
> 2
11
> 121
Right!
15
> 100
Wrong!
21
> 441'
Wrong format! Try again.
21
> 441
Right!
17
> 289
Right!
13
> 169
Right!
Your mark is 4/5. Would you like to save the result? Enter yes or no.
> yes
What is your name?
> Kate
The results are saved in "results.txt".
```

# Afterword
- After finishing this stage, you are totally free to improve the project in any way you like to make it a more convenient and useful tool.<br>

- You can add any features to your application.<br>
It will not be verified by tests, so there are no strict requirements.

- Sample ideas:
    1. Add a complex exam.<br>
    Increase a difficulty level on the fly.<br>
    For example, if a person passed the 1st level, start the 2nd one immediately.
    2. You can add a correction level: store the tasks with wrong answers and give them next time.
    3. Add more difficulty levels.
    4. Track the time (read about Timer).
    5. Write a more detailed report to a file with the results.
    6. Show previous results inside the app (show lines from _results.txt_ that contains the username)
    7. Any other improvement that might be useful!
