# Goal
- Use the random number generator to make your tasks random.

# Description
- Any test includes at least one task.<br>
This task can vary in difficulty and required timeframes.<br>
There can be more than one task; they can demand different forms of answers.<bt>
One thing remains â€” if there's a task, there's a solution.<br>
And we need to assess it.

- Math tasks can vary in difficulty.<br>
`1 * 3` is easy.<br>
`75 * 34` is a bit more difficult.<br>
For the next stages, think about levels of difficulty that you can add!

- For now, let's use random numbers from `2` to `9` and integer operations: `+`, `-` and `*`.

# Objective
1. Generate a math task that looks like a math operation.<br>
Use the requirements above. Print it.
2. Read the answer from a user.
3. Check whether the answer is correct. Print `Right!` or `Wrong!`

# Example
- The greater-than symbol followed by a space (`>` ) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.

### Example 1:
```
5 * 7
> 35
Right!
```

### Example 2:
```
5 * 7
> 5
Wrong!
```
