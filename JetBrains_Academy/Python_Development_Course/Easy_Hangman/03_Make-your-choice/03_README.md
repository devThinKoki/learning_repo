Description
    If there is a predefined word, the game isn't replayable. 
    You already know the word, so thereâ€™s no longer any challenge. 
    At this stage, let's make the game more challenging by choosing a word from a special list with a variety of options. 
    This way, our game will have more replay value.

Objectives
    1. Create the following list of words: 
       'python', 'java', 'kotlin', 'javascript'.
    2. Program the game to choose a word from the list at random. 
       You can enter more words, but let's stick to these four for now.

Example
    The greater-than symbol followed by a space (> ) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the output.

    Example 1. The computer randomly chose python from the list.
        H A N G M A N
        Guess the word: > python
        You survived!

    Example 2. The computer randomly chose something other than python from the list.
        H A N G M A N
        Guess the word: > python
        You lost!

    Example 3. The computer randomly chose something other than kotlin from the list.
        H A N G M A N
        Guess the word: > kotlin
        You lost!
