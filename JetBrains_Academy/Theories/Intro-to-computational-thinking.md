# Intro to computational thinking

A programming language allows us to explain to a computer how to execute a solution to a particular problem in the real world.<br>
But first, a programmer has to come up with the solutions, also using a skill necessary for any type of programming no matter the language.<br>
It is called computational thinking.

## 1. What is computational thinking?
Computers can only deal with clear, concise instructions that agree with the rules of formal logic.<br>
However, real-world problems are rarely cut so clearly.<br>
**Computational thinking** is a set of mental skills helping to see the problems as a set of complex information processes that we can transform into a particular set of instructions for a computer.

Approach every problem you encounter while learning a programming language as not only the opportunity to remember the syntax of the language but also as an opportunity to train computational thinking.

To do that, you can follow a simple algorithm:
1. **Describe the problem**<br>
What exactly needs to be done?<br>
What input data are you given and what does the desired outcome look like?
2. **Identify the important details needed to solve this problem**<br>
Before thinking of a solution, make sure you take into account all the important aspects of the problem.<br>
The devil is in the details, and in case of programming, it hides in edge cases.
3. **Decompose**<br>
Break the problem down into small, logical steps until you know exactly how to code each part of it.
4. **Use these steps to create an algorithm that solves the problem**<br>
Connect the pieces of the problem in a way that would produce the desired outcome in all specified cases.
5. **Evaluate the process**<br>
Usually, a problem has at least a few solutions, and it’s very useful to evaluate your idea to make sure you've chosen a way that is as efficient as possible.

## 2. Conclusion
Since computational thinking is a skill, it requires lots of practice before you can easily apply it.<br>
Don’t despair if your only thought when looking at a problem is that you have no idea how to achieve the desired results.<br>
Use the algorithms we described and keep on breaking the problem down until you see how to explain it to a computer with the tools of the programming language you chose.

## 3. Practices
### 1. Solve like a pro
Put all the steps of solving a programming problem in the right order.
```
1. Problem description
2. Identifying important details of the problem
3. Decomposition
4. Creating an algorithm
5. Evaluate of the solution
```

### 2. The pumpkin pie recipe
Imagine you created a robot that will help you around the house.<br>
And now you want it to bake a pumpkin pie, so you need to come up with a procedure.<br>
The steps are listed below, but now you need to put them in the right order.
```
1. Read the list of ingredients and buy all of the ingredients in the shop.
2. Start heating the oven and prepare all necessary ingredients.
3. Combine eggs, pumpkin puree, sweetened condensed milk, and pumpkin pie spice in a large bowl.
4. Fit pie crust into a dish and pour pumpkin mixture into the crust.
5. Place the pie on a baking sheet and bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes.
6. Switch off the oven and place the pie on the table.
