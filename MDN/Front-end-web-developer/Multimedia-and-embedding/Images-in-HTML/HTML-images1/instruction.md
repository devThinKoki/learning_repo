<h1>HTML images 1</h1>
<p>In this task we want you to embed a simple image of some Blueberries into the page. You need to:</p>
<ul>
    <LI>Add the path to the image to an appropriate attribute to embed it on the page. The image is called blueberries.jpg, and it is in a folder inside the current folder called images.</LI>
    <LI>Add some alternative text to an appropriate attribute to describe the image, for people that cannot see it.</LI>
    <LI>Give the <img> element an appropriate width and height so that it displays at the correct aspect ratio, and enough space is left on the page to display it. The image's intrinsic size is 615 x 419 pixels.</LI>
</ul>
